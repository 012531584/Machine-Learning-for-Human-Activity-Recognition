# SVM-for-Human-Activity-Recognition

This project attempts to search and apply effective methods to analyze and recognize human activities by the inertial signal data collected from the sensors in smartphones. We are trying to build a possible classifier gained by Support Vector Machine (SVM). Meanwhile, exploreing how dimension reduction affect the classifierâ€™s performance by using Principle Component Analysis (PCA). Moreover, we try to find the best parameter of SVM with the help of cross validation, SVM with different kernels or penalty value, and find SVM with rbf kernel combining with 100 penalty value is able to provide more precise performance.

Data Description:

The data set was downloaded from UCI Machine Repository(https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones). 
In this experiment, researchers set six labels including standing, sitting, lying, walking, walking downstairs, walking upstairs. Through the specific sensor, the velocity and acceleration of the angular and linear movement could be obtained. Specifically, these data were all in three-dimensions. There were only seventeen kinds of data we could get initially. Through mathematical calculation (a Fast Fourier Transform was used), we could get the data of the accelerometer and gyroscope in different axials (including the different combination of the axials). The total amount of the features was 561.
